# dev notes

## steps

- dockerfile: `FROM node:14`

```bash
npm install typescript
npm install eslint-config-airbnb --save-dev
npm install eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev
```

## sgpt

Here is an example Dockerfile that can run create-react-app:

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

To use this Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in your project directory.
2. Copy the above Dockerfile content into the `Dockerfile` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
4. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```
   docker build -t my-react-app .
   ```
   This will create a Docker image with the tag `my-react-app`.
5. Run a Docker container using the created image with the following command:
   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
   ```
   This will start the container and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of your local machine.
6. Access your React application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

# create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
